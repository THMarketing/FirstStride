We have 3 events tentatively scheduled in MN thus far. This one has all of the details finalized. They would like registration to open 6 weeks prior to the event starting. Two questions
1. Will this logo work (especially for the printed pieces)?
2. Can we add a “Boy/Girl” field for this event since they are doing one for each? Or should we create 2 separate events?
