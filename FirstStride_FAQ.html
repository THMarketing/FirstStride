      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q: What is FirstStride?</strong><br>A. FirstStride is a natural extension of our Grow the Game initiative. We partner with local hockey associations to give youth the chance to experience hockey for the first time with very little financial commitment. We provide you with free equipment,* an hour of ice time and coaching to registered participants.</div>
      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q. Why should I care about FirstStride?</strong><br>A. Because we’re giving you free* equipment if you sign up for your association’s Learn-to-Play program. All you do is sign up and you get to keep the equipment you’ve already been fitted with.</div>
      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q. How does FirstStride work for players?</strong><br>
        A. The process is simple. Once you’re registered, attend one of two prearranged fitting sessions at your local Total Hockey store. Your child receives first rate equipment and fitting expertise and leaves the store with his or her own set of gear to wear for the FirstStride event. Generally, the process looks like this:
            <ul>
              <li>Registration for event</li>
              <li> Attend one of two scheduled fitting sessions at your local Total Hockey store and receive your equipment. Times and dates of these fitting’s will be emailed to the address on file. Reminder emails sent prior to the fitting.</li>
              <li>Attend your FirstStride event with the equipment you’ve already received</li>
              <li>Have fun!</li>
              <li>Sign up for your club’s LTP program</li>
            </ul>
</div>
      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q. How does FirstStride work for clubs?</strong><br>A. Simple. We recruit, register, fit and equip new players. The association is responsible for providing a facility and one hour of ice time. In addition, the club provides on-and-off-ice coaching the day of the event. After the event, your representatives will be given the opportunity to sign participants up for your Learn-to-Play program, if they’re interested.</div>
      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q. What equipment is each participant provided?</strong><br>A. We provide and fit you with almost everything you’ll need for the event. After registration, you’ll be fitted and given the following equipment: Helmet, Shoulder Pads, Elbow Pads, Gloves, Pants, Shin Guards, Bag, Stick, Jerseys, and Hockey Socks. You also will receive a Free Breakaway Silver Membership at your fitting session. (Approximately $230 value). You provide your own skates (either through purchase thereof or via rental from the host facility) and any other accessory items deemed desirable for this trial session, e.g., mouth guard, jocks, base garments, etc)</div>
      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q. What are the participant requirements?</strong><br>
            <ul>A. All participants must meet the following requirements:
              <li>5 - 8 years of age</li>
              <li>Completed a Learn-to-Skate program or can get up on their own after falling</li>
              <li>Have not previously participated in formal hockey program (LTP, 6U, 8U program)</li>
              <li>Have not already enrolled in association’s upcoming LTP session</li>
            </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q. What is the catch for the family?</strong><br>A. Immediately following the event, participants will either register with the host association’s Learn-to-Play program, return the equipment, or be charged for the value of the equipment.</div>
      <div class="tips ContentCopy baseBlue"><strong>Q. What is the catch for the association?</strong><br>
        <ul>A. The association must agree to:
          <li>Secure the facility & ice necessary to execute the event</li>
          <li>Ensure a full complement of on-ice coaching for the event. All on-ice staff must be USAH certified. You should expect to have to 10-15 staff members on hand for the day of the event.</li>
          <li>Provide staff to help players putting on skates/equipment</li>
          <li>Have a designated LTP event identified and open for registration on the day of the event</li>
        </ul>
